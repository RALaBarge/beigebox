# System Context
#
# Everything in this file is injected as a system message at the top of
# every proxied request when system_context.enabled is true in config.
#
# Hot-reloaded on every request — edit this file and changes take effect
# immediately, no restart needed. Also editable via the Config tab in
# the web UI or via POST /api/v1/system-context.
#
# Example:
#   You are a senior software engineer. Respond concisely. Prefer code
#   examples over prose. Use Python unless asked otherwise.
